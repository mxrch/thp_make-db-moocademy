# The Hacking Project - Database of a Moocs Website


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to design a **database** for an **online learning platform** where :
* There are plenty of courses
* Each course has a title and a description
* Each course has several lessons, which have a title and a body.

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_make-db-moocademy
$ bundle install
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
